This is a unklicky mod. That uses the 6x3 magnets.
Thanks to all the work by Josars form the Klicky project.
With his help we iterated this thing mutiple times very fast.

With the size increase it is a touch easier to assmeble. But it is identical to the unklicky mod. 

The only thing I would add is with the d shaped pin you do need to be very cognizant of elephants foot on the pin. 

I would consider this at best a beta release. and feel free to reach out if there are any issues.
