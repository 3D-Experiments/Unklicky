# What do I need?

## Bom
| Name | Pieces |
| ------ | ------ |
| 6x3MM Magnet | 5|
|12 or 14 mm M3 screw| 1|
|18 to 22 AWG wire| <100 mm|


## Printed parts
| Name | Pieces |
| ------ | ------ |
| BFP_Unklicky_v6.stlt | 1|
|D_pin_v6.stl| 1|

## Build

1. Ensure the pin and body slide together very well. Sand or clean up any parts that do not slide well. And that a screw in the pin slot can slide up and down correctly.  

2. Insert rear top magnet. Note: needs to be aligned to attract to dock magnet if existing mount is in place. Or if this is a new installation will need to be reversed alignment from the front 2 slots we will do later.

3. Strip and wrap the wire around the pin with the starting point being on the D-cut side of the pin. Multiple wraps around the pin can be used for thinner wires. But you want to be careful to have it flat on the bottom. And use a single twist and cut any extra off on the side as wire binding will cause the pin to not move smoothly.

4. Place a magnet on top of the installed rear magnet. And use that to insert the pin mag into the pin. This magnet will be pushed not pulled. So it is not critical to be super secure. For that reason the fit is fairly loose and you may need to slide it off the top. This is by design to prevent any swelling in the pin that can cause roughness in the pin sliding.

5. Slot the other end of the wire for the pin through the body to the top of the body. Note: in the newer body this will be easier to see and slot. But it is very similar to threading a needle.  Cut and strip the wire on on top with the stripped end going under either magnet.

6. Slot a new wire for the contact screw strip a small portion of wire. This can either be stuck into the hole and insert the wire or wrap the wire around the screw. 
7. On top strip the other side of wire and place under the other front magnet.

8. Screw the contact screw into place. Ensure that the pin is pushed in and aligned correctly. And that the pin is sliding as expected. 

9. Change the z height for Probe and QGL/z-tilt to a move height of 25 mm. This should work for any of the BFP. 
10. While I am not going to go into auto z here. The unklicky currently can start with a switch offset of 6 mm and BFP 3 mm. These should set you a touch high and can be adjusted down. The main variability here is the wire wrap height. But this should be safe for almost anybody. PLEASE test I do not want to see pictures of damaged PEI sheets.


Glue can be used as needed but please ensure it does not interfere with wire contact. 

Please feel free to reach out if you have any issues.
