1. The edge that is on the plate during printing for the d shaped pin. Ensure that any elephant foot on the inside of the slide is cleaned out. 
2. D-shaped pin the mag should just sit down in the slot it does not need to be pressed. 
3. Added a internal chamfer to allow the wiring to be installed easier. No funtional diffrence just allows wires to slide for installation easier. 

If it is loose you can use a drop of glue to keep it on top. There is no need for the magnet to make contact with the wire.

This is a unklicky mod. That uses the 6x3 magnets.
Thanks to all the work by Josars form the Klicky project.
With his help we iterated this thing mutiple times very fast.

With the size increase it is a touch easier to assmeble. But it is identical to the unklicky mod. 

The only thing I would add is with the d shaped pin you do need to be very cognizant of elephants foot on the pin. 

I would consider this at best a beta release. and feel free to reach out if there are any issues.

With the D-shaped shaft make sure there is no elephant foot to interfere wiht the motion. 
we have found for the wire to to the PIN/stalk it does seem to work better with a bare wire. 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any issues.
