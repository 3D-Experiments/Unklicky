# Update 3/30/22
added a alpha release under BFP
This is a 6x3 unklicky probe. Thanks go to JosAR for all the hard work and testing.

With the D-shaped shaft make sure there is no elephant foot to interfere wiht the motion. 
we have found for the wire to to the PIN/stalk it does seem to work better with a bare wire. 
Please feel free to reach out if you have any issues.

First this is all based on an additional option to be used with the Klicky mod. This is not a replacement just an alternative to test the longevity of a mag based spring in a probe. This is actually version 2. I have made a previous version that was normally open. While it worked. It would not allow all the wonderful safety based work that has been done on the klicky to work as intended. 

Please support his project and all the hard work he has done and is continuing to do.

Also keep in mind all this is based off the orginal work done over at Annex Enginerring the excellent work that was done with the quickdraw probe. 
Thanks for calling this out. I did know the orginal was based on thier work but it slipped my mind. They have an excellent group that does a lot of good things for the community. Support them in there work and thanks for keeping me honest here guys.

I am looking for feedback on the design. As I do not feel even though it works well for me a test of 1 is sufficient. 

It uses (2) magnet sizes. The standard 6x3 magnets as the klicky on the main body in all the normal locations. But uses a miniscule 3X2 magnet in the stalk. I know it's yet another magnet size. But it was the only way to keep the same foot print and keep it as a drop-in replacement.

# But how does it work!! 
There has been a lot of questions around this. So hopefully I can shed some light. 
The Probe uses an internal magnet on top of the pin/stalk. This magnet is not part of the circuit it is only used to provide a spring for the the probe. 

The real part of the probing is actually done by the screw. 
There is a contact point between the screw and the wire. This allows the unklicky to be normally closed.

# Printing 
There is only one thing. I have found so far is that the wire holes have to be so close to the edge. You need to turn on overlapping perimeter in susperslicer to keep the top together.

# The build 

Gather Up all the materials. Test fit the pin ensure it is not binding or to tight. it should slide easily in and out without binding.

## The Pin

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%202.jpg "Build")

Strip a length of wire and thread through the hole in the pin. 

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%203.jpg "Build")

Flip the wire over towards the opposite side of the pin. 

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%204.jpg "Build")

You want a single twist of wire. NOT TO MUCH this will cause issues if you leave to much here. Trim the excess. 
If you have issues with the fit you can strip the wire completely bare. 

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%205.jpg "Build")

Insert the magnet in the top of the pin. THis does not need to be crunched down. It is not designed to be tight. 
If you have issues with it slipping use a drop of glue.
There does not need to be contact between the wire and the magnet. But contact will not hurt it either. 

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%206.jpg "Build")

Run the wire up the hole a tiny bend at the end may be useful. 

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%207.jpg "Build")

Pull the wire as you continue to insert it until it is fully seated.

![Build](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Step%208.jpg "Build")

Finally strip the end if it is not bare and lay under the magnet and insert your magnet.
