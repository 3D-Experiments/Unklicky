Drop in magnet based klicky probe


First this is all based on an addtional option to be used with the Klicky mod. This is not a replacment just an altenative to test the longivity of a mag based spring in a probe. Please support his project and all the hard work he has done and is continuing to do. https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe 

I am looking for feedback on the design. As I do not feel even though it works well for me a test of 1 is sufficnet. 

It uses the standard 6x3 magnets as the klicky in all the normal locations. But uses a miniscule 2x3 magnet in the stalk. I know it's yet another magnet size. But it was the only way to keep the same footprint and keep it as a dropin replacement.
