Drop in magnet based klicky probe

First this is all based on an additional option to be used with the Klicky mod. This is not a replacement just an alternative to test the longevity of a mag based spring in a probe. 

Please support his project and all the hard work he has done and is continuing to do.

I am looking for feedback on the design. As I do not feel even though it works well for me a test of 1 is sufficient. 

It uses the standard 6x3 magnets as the klicky in all the normal locations. But uses a miniscule 2x3 magnet in the stalk. I know it's yet another magnet size. But it was the only way to keep the same foot print and keep it as a drop-in replacement.
