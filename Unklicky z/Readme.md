Unklicky z V3 

Moved the bottom magnet inside the body to allow it to be closer to provide more lift. 
Changed the contact to not require a wire wrap. Now the heatset will contact to the contact screw directly. 
Wire is securured under the screw now to make a cleaner method of securing. 

There has been a script created to test the noozle ooze that can be used for any probes and endstops.  But do want to thank Jkwang for a great new tool. You can grab it from his github at https://github.com/johnnykwwang/3dp_notes/tree/main/auto_z_accuracy_test.
