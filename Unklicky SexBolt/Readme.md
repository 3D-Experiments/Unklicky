## Build
| Instruction | Image |
| ------ | ------ |
|1. Ensure the pin and body slide together very well. Sand or clean up any parts that do not slide well. And that a screw in the pin slot can slide up and down correctly.| |  
|2. Insert bottom magnet. For the Bearing version use a large hex wrench to reach the bottom and slot the magnet into place. On the sleeve version it is on the bottom part.  | ![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|3. Use a iron to press the heat set into the end of the pin. Being very careful to stay away from the mag retaining walls. There is a bump added to the model I can feel the heat set when it hits these stops but it possible to push past these stops. So you want a almost hairline amount of heat set showing in the screw slot. Also since we are pressing this through plastic use a pick or file to ensure the bottom of the heat set is clear of plastic to make a good connection.|![Instructions](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/HS_fit.jpg "Instructions")![Instructions](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/HS_Stop.jpg "Instructions")|
|4. Strip and wrap the wire around the m3 screw with sticking out on the D-cut side of the pin.|![Instructions](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Ex_pin.jpg "Instructions")|
|5. Place a magnet on outside of the body of the installed bottom magnet. And use that to insert the pin mag into the pin. This magnet will be pushed not pulled. So it is not critical to be super secure. For that reason the fit is fairly loose and you may need to slide it off the top. This is by design to prevent any swelling in the pin that can cause roughness in the pin sliding.|![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|6. Slot the other end of the wire for the pin through the bottom rear hole.|![Instructions]![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|7. Press a heat set in the front of the body. |![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")
|8. Press 2 heat sets in the bottom of the body if using the sleeve version.| ![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|9. Wrap the second wire around the contact screw. Screw the contact screw into place from the rear. Ensure that the pin is pushed in and aligned correctly. And that the pin is sliding as expected.| ![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|10. If using the sleeve version use 2 m3X6 mm screws to attach the bottom to the body.|![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions") | 
|11. thread the m4 rod into the end of the pin.| ![SexBolt](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky/raw/main/pictures/Unklicky_sexbolt.jpg "Instructions")|
|12. Press the sleeve or bearing firmly into the top of the body. And screw the SexBolt onto the m4 rod.| |
|13. Crimp the wires from the sex bolt and from the board with the microfit connectors.| |
|14. Screw the sex bolt body to the extrusions using 2 m3 x 8 screws. This does assume that you use the existing end stop hardware.| |
